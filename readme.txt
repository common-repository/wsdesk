**What is a Help Desk or Support Ticket System?**

In customer service parlance, a ticketing system or support ticket system is a software that takes all incoming customer support requests, create a unique customer service ticket and then routes it through a defined customer support process based on the SLA. 

People call it different names such as Support Ticket System, Customer Support System, Service Desk, Support Ticketing System, IT help desk or Support Desk Software. But ultimately, a help desk software typically allows the support team to manage, track, sort, and search for issues (user queries) making ticket management much easier for the agent to help the customer more quickly solve the issue to their satisfaction.

**Why you need a support ticket system to handle customer support?**

A better customer experience starts with better help desk software. It can turn support tickets into amazing customer experiences. Help desk system enables support agents to track, prioritize, and solve customer support tickets. A great help desk is at the heart of great customer support.

Help desk software helps streamline customer support with time-saving tools like triggers and automations. It's intuitive and easy to use because it's built with both customers and support desk agents in mind.

A help desk's shared inbox enables the support team to collaborate and resolve issues without worrying about overlapping or missing support requests. Every request sent to the support email becomes a ticket in the helpdesk. Support tickets can be easily categorized and prioritized and then assigned to the right people in the support team.

Issues such as multiple agents responding to the same ticket or missing some of the tickets are taken care of as each support agent can see who is working on what ticket and its status. It time to get started with a customer support ticket system if you already don't have one. 


**Different types of support ticket systems**

**Web helpdesk software:** Also referred to as cloud-hosted or software-as-a-service (SaaS), web helpdesk is hosted on the vendor's server. Customers need to pay a monthly subscription fee to use this kind of customer support system.

**On-premise helpdesk software:** An on-premise helpdesk system is a customer support systems which is usually installed in its own server after buying a license. Such helpdesk systems usually involves a one-time setup fee and additional customizations charges based on requirement.


**Enterprise helpdesk software:** These are  help desk software solutions with robust features, featuring advanced modules other than standard help desk features such as ticketing, time tracking, and knowledge base. Some enterprise helpdesk systems also include modules such as IT asset management, account management, service request management, and survey management.

**Open-source help desk software:** This is one of the popular helpdesk software types as some of these apps are offered free. 

**Benefits of open-source helpdesk software**

An open source help desk allows developers to access its source code, as opposed to proprietary software. So, an open source helpdesk can be modified or enhanced beyond the level of simple integration and adding plugins. Developers can add features or modify processes or fix bugs in the system. WSDesk (Wordpress Support Desk) is an open source support ticketing system which works with Wordpress and WooCommerce. This is the best helpdesk software available for WordPress/WooCommerce platform if the usability and customer support are considered.
